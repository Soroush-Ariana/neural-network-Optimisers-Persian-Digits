# Comparative Analysis of Adam and Momentum Optimizers for Persian Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project provides a comparative analysis of two optimisation algorithms—Adam and Momentum—used to enhance the training process of a neural network. The algorithms are evaluated in terms of accuracy on a task focused on recognizing Persian handwritten digits, demonstrating their effectiveness in optimising neural network performance.
